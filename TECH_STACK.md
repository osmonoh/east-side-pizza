# TECHNOLOGY DECISIONS

-   Routing -> React Router - The standard for React SPAs
-   Styling -> tailwindcss - Trendy way of styling applications
-   Remote state management -> React Router - New way of fetching data right inside React Router (v6.4+) that is worth exploring ("render-as-you-fetch" instead of "fetch-on-render"). Not really state management, as it doesn't persist state.
-   UI State management -> Redux - State is fairly complex. Redux has many advantages for UI state.

This is just one or many tech stacks we could have chosen, not necessarily the best but I wanted to show what can be done
